After than, clone *your repository* and install Marp CLI. (Required [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 8)

```
git clone https://github.com/[your-name]/[repository-name].git
npm install

OK, ready to write your slide deck! Edit **`PITCHME.md`** with your favorite editor. By pushing Git commit to `master`, Netlify will host the deck to website.
